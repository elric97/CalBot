# aPAS - A Personal Agile Scheduler

## Introduction üòÅ
Have you ever wondered how easy it would be if there was someone to help you manage your mundane tasks in a better way? If you have then aPAS has got you covered!

Do you ever want to find time for leetcode and workouts amidst a very busy week full of assignments but just can‚Äôt? Our discord bot will look into your existing schedule and will further help you handle such unscheduled tasks. How will it do that? It will show you the exact amount of workload pending on your plate and time left before the deadline. This makes scheduling such unscheduled events very easy.

## Future Scope üêæ
There are multiple dimensions to this project catering to the interests of
Various developers. Please check [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for contributing rules

### If you are a front-end developer üíª
Currently aPAS has been configured to work with Discord as the GUI but given the structure of the project it can be easily extended for other platforms such as
* Telegram (add links probably!)
* WhatsApp
* Facebook 

### If you are a back-end developer üõ†Ô∏è
Why just stop at Google calendar? Why not make it more user-friendly for all users with various calendars such as:
* Samsung Calendar
* Apple calendar
Extending aPAS for these will require addition of service classes for these calendars

### If you are an ML Enthusiast üßë‚Äçüî¨
* Why not use a voice-bot to set and manage events,Implementing this using an audio model can be an interesting extension to the project.
* The priority algorithm can be personalized for a user based on the amount of time they spend on a particular task.
