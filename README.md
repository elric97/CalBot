# aPAS - A Personal Agile Scheduler
Many companies use agile methodology for software development and manage everything from requirement gathering to product delivery smoothly, by following some good practices.
Managing everyone's assignment using sprint model is very effective and gives the true picture of how much of assignment load someone has and how to further manage it.

*Then why not to use it in daily life?*

In daily life it's quite difficult to manage mundane tasks using some jira tools etc, which can show you exact amount of workload pending on your plate and time left before the deadline. The best way to manage it is by using some chatbot, which at some point can look into your existing schedule and can further able to handle other unscheduled items like study, playing, coding etc.
If integrated with some personal assistant like alexa, siri, cortana, ok google, this can actually help scheduling such unscheduled events in very easy way.

So here we are trying to make similar prototype, but instead of personal assistant we are using discord bot for now.
