|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z|doc page entries|
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing|[Why aPas](https://github.com/elric97/CalBot#introduction-)
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|[Video](https://github.com/elric97/CalBot#heres-a-short-introduction-video)

| the files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up|[Contributing.md](https://github.com/elric97/CalBot/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
| issues are discussed before they are closed|even if you discuss in slack, need a summary statement here|

| test cases:.a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.|if a test case fails, open an issue and fix it|
| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files|
| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)|
| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)|
| evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base|
|short release cycles | |
